Common dolphins are so much of a fun thing, they should also be called extraordinary. They are the most abundant of flipper friends found off Laguna Beach. More than 400,000 dolphins can be found off the Southern California coast.</p><p>"We had a great trip! Captain Dave was amazing. He made sure that we went to a location where dolphins are frequently seen. We were fortunate to get to swim with and snorkel with them. It was a fantastic adventure that I now have on my bucket list. I highly recommend Panama Beach Dolphin Tours LLC.</p></div>

You won't be able to stop laughing at that video. Even the most hardened of us can admit that dolphins laughing at humans is quite funny. 16 May 2019</p><p>The "Belly Ride" allows you to touch dolphins' bellies while holding onto their pectoral fins. The "Boogie Push", which is the last activity of the day, is the same as "Foot Push", but you'll be pushed while riding a boogieboard.</p></div>
