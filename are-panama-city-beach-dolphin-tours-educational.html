<div><p>Come and join us for a fun boat excursion and a chance to see bottlenose dolphins – one of nature’s most charismatic characters. Call (850) 756-7512 to reserve your spot on one of our Panama Beach Dolphin Tours today!</p><p>Sea lions are not usually dangerous. <b>Dock</b>  Although they aren't aggressive, sea lions tend to keep to their own pace and don't get into fights. However, as wild animals of 600 pounds, they must be respected. There have been instances when sea lions have inflicted injury on humans.</p><p>Swim with Panama City’s resident pod of wild bottle-nosed dolphins in their natural home on your trip aboard super-fast boats specially designed for finding and visiting with the dolphins. We are located in Panama City Beach and near Seaside, Rosemary Beach, Santa Rosa, Destin, Mexico Beach & Cape San Blas as well as all of 30A  and Beaches of South Walton FL.</p><br><br><h2>Are Panama City Beach dolphin tours educational - Deck</h2><ol><li>Testimony</li><li>Amazement</li><li>Voyage</li><li>Enjoyment</li><li>Journey</li><li>Tropical</li><li>Kayaking</li><li>Weather</li><li>Milestone</li><li>Wind</li><li>Achievement</li><li>Story</li></ol></div>
