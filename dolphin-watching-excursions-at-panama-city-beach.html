<div><p>Orcas are apex prey, meaning they are the most powerful predators in the ocean. They have no predators and can be found at the top end of the food chain. Killer whales, which are the largest and most powerful animal in the ocean, can be beaten by no predator.</p><p>The number of passengers on our Panama Beach Dolphin Tours is limited to six. Our guests can explore St. Andrew Bay comfortably, have a good conversation with their tour captain and see the dolphins up close. Your captain will bring the tour boat as close as possible to the dolphins, while being respectful and cautious to avoid causing them stress.</p><p>This means that dolphins don’t have a fixed schedule. However, they are more active during daylight as it is essential for hunting and other social activities.</p> <b>Map</b></div>
